# Project Description
A C# library to read and write files using the NBT format described on http://www.minecraft.net/docs/NBT.txt

This is pretty much only useful to people making support utilities for Minecraft.

If you need a different license put create a feature request on the issue tracker and I'll probably be willing to.

I didn't see a way to add more licenses but you can also use the source under cc-by-sa.

I'll update if there are bugs, but this is pretty much done.
